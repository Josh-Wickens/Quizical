# **Quizical**


Quizical is the perfect place to test your Harry Potter knowledge. If it's just a case of testing your knowledge trying questions or if you want to put your knowledge to the test and try to answer as many questions right in 1 minute. Most quizzes will give you a certain amount of questions and give you a score out of the number of questions, whereas this quiz will give you the opportunity to try and get the highscore and see if your friends can beat your score. The quiz is for all ages and all knowledge levels. The questions range from easy to hard, so you should be able to really test how much you know.

## **Motivation** ##
I am a Harry Potter fan and I would love to see how much I really know. This website would have given me that opportunity to test my knowledge. I would like a quiz game which you could play with your friends. So in my head I thought a quiz which you could pass around and see who could get the best score sounded perfect.
